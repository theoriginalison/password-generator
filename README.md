## Approach & Process
- I first thought about the type of variables that I would need to create, and then realized that I would also need to create arrays that contained all of the possible characters.
- Eventually, making an object seemed to make the most sense.

## Problems & Solutions
- Wanting to have at least one of each character chosen by the user to be in a password. My initial inclination was to run a loop of whichever characters the user chose (the loop would select random characters from that array) over and over, until it reached a max of the number of characters set by the user in the prompt alert.

## Discoveries
- I might have actually pronounced concatenation correctly?!
